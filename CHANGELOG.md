Features in the latest push to this release:

* An "Eligibility Widget" can be used to insert the same message inside the mini cart, or into other hooking points 
* The module adds a payment method to the checkout, which redirects the user to Alma's payment page.  
If everything goes right (i.e. Customer doesn't cancel, pays the right amount, ... ), the created order is validated
upon customer return.
* An IPN controller is called from Alma's API to ensure order validation when the customer wouldn't return to the shop
